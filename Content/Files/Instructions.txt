Alright buddy. I'm just going to read out the names of the graves you need to rob and you should be out of there in no time.[CANSKIP]
You can move around with the WASD keys. Digging a grave should just take a single swing of your shovel. Left click a grave when you're close enough to dig it.[CANSKIP]
Oh and by the way, the spirits you're stealing from won't be happy. If they lay a hand on you, you're done! Try luring them away when you're trying to dig.[CANSKIP]
You got all that? Okay. First grave we are looking for is the one belonging to an Edmond Cuff. Wait... you can't read?!?! It's cool, I'll just try my best to describe where it was when I investigated the area.
First grave should be on your left when you walked in.
Second one is right next to the first.
Last one should be directly accross the first one.
Good work. Now move on to the next area. The sprits shouldn't be able to follow you in.[DONTAPPEND]
Okay now I remember this grave being awful close to a tree, look for it.
The next one should be the only wooden grave in the area.
Last one should be the only other unique one in the area.
You're doing great. Move on to the next area.[DONTAPPEND]
The first grave you'll need to rob is the one furthest away from the only round stone grave in the area.
Count how many wooden graves there are. The next one should be that many graves away from the first.
Now count how many stone graves there are. The next one should be that many graves away from the second.
Well done! Now get out of there and into the next area![DONTAPPEND]
Grave number one of this area is surrounded by 4 wooden graves in all 4 directions.
The next one has a stone cross to its left, and wood grave to its right.
The last one only has round stone graves surrounding it.
Good work. Now move on to the next area. The sprits shouldn't be able to follow you in.[DONTAPPEND]
Okay, this area is a gold mine. Dig every grave you can get your hands on, they've all got treasure. Just make sure to the order you dig carefully otherwise you'll get overrun!
Nice! We are going to be rich!
Three More! Try luring the spirits away before trying to dig!
Almost done!
One more!
Great work! Now get out of there![DONTAPPEND]

Alright, you're doing great so far. From what I've heard, these graves get more challenging. The next grave is at the intersection of the four trees.
Awesome. The next grave is 6 fence length's horizontally from the entrance.
Almost done, The final grave is the stone grave bertween the previous two.
We are going to be rich! Great job out there.[DONTAPPEND]
