Alright buddy. I'm just going to read out the names of the graves you need to rob and you should be out of there in no time.[CANSKIP]
You can move around with the WASD keys. Digging a grave should just take a single swing of your shovel. Left click a grave when you're close enough to dig it.[CANSKIP]
You got all that? Okay. First grave we are looking for is the one belonging to an Edmond Cuff. Wait... you can't read?!?! It's cool, I'll just try my best to describe where I remember it being when I investigated the area.
First grave should be on your left when you walked in.
Next one is right next to the first.
Last one should be directly accross the first one.
Good work. Now move on to the next area. The sprits shouldn't be able to follow you in.[DONTAPPEND]
